BitBrawlers is an innovative blockchain-based pet battle game built on Polkadot's Moonbase Alpha testnet, showcasing the power of Web3 gaming and cross-chain compatibility. Players can mint unique NFT cats as ERC721 tokens, each with distinct attributes including attack, defense, speed, and health stats. The game features ENS integration, allowing players to give custom names to their pets through Ethereum Name Service subdomains, creating personalized and memorable gaming experiences.


Built using Scaffold-ETH 2 framework and RainbowKit for seamless wallet connectivity, BitBrawlers demonstrates modern Web3 development practices. The smart contract includes comprehensive battle mechanics, pet leveling systems, and owner management functionality. Players can engage in strategic battles, level up their cats, and compete in an immersive blockchain gaming ecosystem. The project leverages Polkadot's EVM compatibility while maintaining the security and interoperability benefits of the Polkadot network, making it accessible to both Ethereum and Polkadot users.
